          ones. No animal products, no dairy, lightly spiced, moist, and not overly sweet, it will fill your kitchen with the warming aromas of
          cinnamon and apple. Follow the masterclass of Shirley Kwok - the Founder of The Cakery and KIRR (Keeping It Real & Raw), if you missed the
          live session of her workshop.
